    <p>You will not receive device firmware updates automatically if you took control of the device in the ESPHome Device Builder add-on (perhaps because you wanted to customize the device in some way). 
      <ul>
        <li>If you wish to update your device after taking control, you'll need to rebuild your device's configuration using either the ESPHome Device Builder add-on or an <a href="https://esphome.io/guides/getting_started_command_line">ESPHome command-line/terminal interface</a>.</li>
        <li>To check if there has been an update that is relevant for your device, check the <a href="https://esphome.io/changelog/">ESPHome changelog</a>.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Unless you have a good reason, donâ€™t take control of the device in the <b>ESPHome Device Builder</b> add-on.</p>
