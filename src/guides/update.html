    <p>You will not receive the device firmware updates automatically if you adopted the device in the ESPHome add-on because you wanted to customize the device further. You will still be able to benefit from updates by <a href="https://esphome.io/projects/">recompiling</a> your device.
    </p>
    <p>Unless you have a good reason, donâ€™t adopt the device in the ESPHome Device Compiler add-on.</p>
